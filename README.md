Hi!

I'm a postdoctoral research fellow at University College Dublin, with a keen interest in palaeoclimate and what we DON'T know about our water resources! I mainly work in R but should really get around to learning Python. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some pretty cool hydroclimate reconstructions for Queensland, Australia
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot more about maps and spatial statistics.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on palaeoclimate projects, especially water and fire!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the weather
