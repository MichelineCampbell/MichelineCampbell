Hi!

I'm a research associate at the University of New South Wales, with a keen interest in palaeoclimate, water resources, and fire! I mainly work in R but should really get around to learning Python. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working ona really great project looking to detect fire events in stalagmite proxy data.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot more about maps and spatial statistics.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on palaeoclimate projects, especially water and fire!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the weather
